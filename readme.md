# Quiz app

## Introduction

The **quiz app** project is a small project done without any
framework or library.

## Questions list

The questions are inside the `questions.json` file.
The structure of that file is that one :

```json
[
  {
    "level": 1,
    "theme": "Theme",
    "question": "What's the correct answer ? (1)",
    "answers": {
      "a": "1",
      "b": "2",
      "c": "3",
      "d": "4",
      "correct": "a"
    }
  }
]
```

The questions included inside this one are only in **French** and the front-end is also in that language.
The source code can be easily adapted for another languages.
